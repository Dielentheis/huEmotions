# Mood Lighting

My hackathon project for Developer Camp 2016. Won "Spotlight" Award.
It changes the color of the lights depending on the emotional content of the messages.
The saturation is determined by the strength of the emotions in each messages (neutral messages produce a less vibrant hue). 

Used Philips Hue Lights, Watson Alchemy Language API, and PubNub for messaging.
